# BlackVault – The Private Offshore Bank That Cannot Die

**One-sentence mission**  
Lock real assets → get fully private, transferable zk-notes → unlock anytime.  
No peg. No trusted setup. No admin keys. No infinite mint bugs. Ever.

We are building a private and secure offshore storage layer — protected from looters, censors, and single points of failure.

## Current Status (November 17, 2025)

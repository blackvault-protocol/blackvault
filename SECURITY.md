# Security Policy

BlackVault is designed to protect real value against confiscation and surveillance.  
Security is non-negotiable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security reports are treated with the highest priority.

**Until a formal bug-bounty program and PGP key are published (Phase 4), please report vulnerabilities directly and privately to:**

**blackvaultprotocol@proton.me**  
(ProtonMail — end-to-end encrypted)

Include:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any proposed mitigation (optional)

Reports will be acknowledged within 24 hours.  
Responsible disclosure is expected and deeply appreciated.

We will publicly credit researchers unless anonymity is requested.

## Current Status

- v5 reference implementation: ~300 lines, fully auditable
- Uses halo2 0.3.1 (Spearbit/Trail-of-Bits audited)
- No external dependencies beyond the Rust standard library and well-audited crates
- No remote servers, no keys stored, no trusted third parties

Formal audit and bug-bounty program will be announced when on-chain components are deployed.

Thank you for helping keep BlackVault unbreakable.

# Security Policy

This project will eventually hold real money. Security is everything.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
For now (Phase 0–1) please email:  
**blackvaultprotocol@proton.me** (end-to-end encrypted ProtonMail)

We will publish a proper PGP key and bug-bounty program in Phase 4.

Thank you for helping us stay unbreakable.
